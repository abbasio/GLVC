# GLVC
Game Library Value Calculator


This is a tool to calculate the value of one's owned games (as CD keys) using the secondary market aggregator gg.deals as a reference point.

You can provide the script with a list of games, and it will construct a simple CSV file with two columns: The game title, and the secondary market price (in USD)

If a game is not found, the entry in your CSV will appear as `<title>, "No Price Found"`
